# NumericalRelativity
A framework written in Julia which implements various methods in numerical relativity, including computing geodesics, extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, and gravitational waveforms. The Examples.ipynb, which is best viewed [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/lennoxkeeble/NumericalRelativity/blob/main/Examples.ipynb) demonstrates how the code can be used.
